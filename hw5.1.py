This program will answer part one of hw5 for scripting

1) A function to create a random graph. This function will take a single parameter for the number
of nodes in the graph, and will return a NetworkX undirected graph object.

2) A function that implements a depth-first search of a graph. This function will take two
parameters: a NetworkX graph object and the node at which to start the search. It will return a
list of node names in the order they were visited. (Hint: use a stack to implement this algorithm)

3) A function that implements a breadth-first search of a graph. This function will take two
parameters: a NetworkX graph object and the node at which to start the search. It will return a
list of node names in the order they were visited. (Hint: use a queue to implement this
algorithm)
